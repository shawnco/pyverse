# Pyverse, or, No Man's Py

Pyverse is a procedurally generated interstellar network simulator written in Python. The goal of Pyverse is to simulate a universe created on the fly using procedural content generation techniques, filled with artifically intelligent alien species, who explore the universe gaining knowledge and transmitting that data to their main database. The interstellar network is also used to perform parallel programming problems, which may be input by the user using a type of assembly language used by the simulation.

## Inspiration

Frankly, I find a lot of things are pretty cool. I employ several topics in Pyverse, each fascinating in its own way:

* Procedural content generation
* Networking concepts
* Artificial intelligence
* Assembly language
* Parallel programming

## Stages of Development

This is my current prediction. It may change as time goes on.

### Phase 1: Objects

In this phase, code is written to create and display the basic objects of the simulation. Not all functionality is implemented, unless it's needed for testing purposes.

### Phase 2: Network

In this phase, functionality to simulate routing principles is added. Packets may be transmitted from one terminal to another, hopping along routers that transmit signals in a limited space.

### Phase 3: Procedural Content Generation

In this phase, PCG techniques are written so that stars, planets, and the like don't have to be manually created. Rather they appear as the player scrolls through the universe.

### Phase 4: Save Files

In this phase, save files are implemented, so that simultations can persist beyond a single run.

### Phase 5: Artificial Intelligence

In this phase, species are created with the ability to build starships and stations, explore the universe, mine resources, and colonize worlds. I imagine this would be the longest phase.

### Phase 6: Assembly Language

In this phase, something akin to an assembly language is developed. This could be run on anything with computational ability, such as a terminal, starbase, or starship.

### Phase 7: Parallel Programming

In this phase, an extension of the existing assembly language is created, that allows for distribution of problems among computers. This would have to be cleverly written so that the computers would know how to distribute array-like data structures, split for loops among computers, etc. This would likely also be a long phase.
